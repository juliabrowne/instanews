# Instanews
Instanews uses the New York Times API to fetch data from articles in order to display them on a custom-built webpage. It displays 12 articles per page and includes a drop-down menu for interactive article category selection. jQuery's ajax() is used to fetch JSON data and format it according to the design of the webpage.
